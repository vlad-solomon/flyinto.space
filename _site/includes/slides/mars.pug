		span.desc Mars is the fourth planet from the Sun and the second-smallest planet in the Solar System after Mercury.

The latter refers to the effect of the iron oxide prevalent on Mars' surface, which gives it a reddish appearance distinctive among the astronomical bodies visible to the naked eye.
